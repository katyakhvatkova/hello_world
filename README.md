## hello_world

Hey everyone! My name is Katya. I'm a recent M.S. graduate with an educational background in applied math and mathematical statistics, and I'm about to start working as a biostatistician in a month. I set up my GitHub account in March 2021 with the intention of figuring out how to use it after I graduated. Now that it's summer and I have some more free time, I want to start working on a few projects and getting some of my existing projects on here...
