## hello_world

Hey everyone! My name is Katya. I'm a biostatistician at Wake Forest School of Medicine who specializes in statistical genetics research. I set up my GitHub account in March 2021 while pursuing an M.S. degree in mathematical statistics at Wake Forest University. Before Wake Forest, I received a B.S. degree in applied mathematics from the University of Alabama. This is my personal GitHub account, and I plan to post work from independent, personal projects here.
